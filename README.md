This is a group project I completed in Fall 2023 as a part of a Data Visualization class. It showcases interactive data visualzations of Spotify's music from 2010 to 2022. I collaborated with 3 other students to create this project whose names are listed in the documentation.

Data sources: [dataset 1]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josephinelsy/spotify-top-hit-playlist-2010-2022)) and [dataset 2]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/estienneggx/spotify-unpopular-songs).)
