This is a group project I completed in Fall 2023 as a part of a Data Visualization class. It showcases interactive data visualzations of Spotify's music from 2010 to 2022. I collaborated with 3 other students to create this project whose names are listed in the report.

The data visualizations are written using HTML and JavaScript.
